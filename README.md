# HR Analytics Dashboard

## Description:

This HR Analytics Dashboard provides valuable insights into your organization's workforce, empowering you to make informed decisions about talent management, recruitment, and employee development. The dashboard offers a clear and concise overview of key metrics across three primary sections:

### 1. Home Page:

- **Employee Headcount:** View the total number of employees, the breakdown by gender, and the percentage distribution.
- **Promotion Insights:** Get a quick glimpse at the number of employees due for promotion based on their service years, along with the total years of service and information about retrenched and non-retrenched employees.
- **Job Level Distribution:** Visualize the distribution of employees across different job levels (Level 1 to Level 5).
- **Distance Status:** Understand the distribution of employees based on their location relative to the workplace (Very Close, Close, Far, Very Far).
- **Promotion Status:** Stay informed about the number of employees who are and are not due for promotion, along with the corresponding percentages.

### 2. Details Page (Employee Promotions by Job Role):

- **Promotion Analytics:** Delve deeper into employee promotions by examining the percentage breakdown of promoted and non-promoted employees across various job roles (Manager, Healthcare Representative, Sales Executive, Research Scientist, and Director).
- **Employee Breakdown:** Gain a detailed understanding of the total employee count per job role, including the number of employees due for promotion and the number of retrenched employees.
- **Interactive Exploration:** Drill down into specific job roles by clicking on the relevant bar in the chart or data point in the table. This reveals more granular details, such as the number of employees at each level within that job role (e.g., Level 1, Level 2) and the number due for promotion at each level.

### 3. Action Page (Employees Who Will Be Promoted or Retrenched):

- **Employee Listing:** Access a comprehensive list of all employees who are either due for promotion or will be retrenched according to their service records. The list includes their names and genders for identification purposes.

## Features:

- **Interactive Visualizations:** Leverage bar charts, pie charts, and tables to gain a clear understanding of various HR metrics.
- **Drill-Down Capabilities:** Explore data in greater depth by clicking on specific elements within visualizations or tables.
- **Clear Presentation:** Information is presented in a well-organized and easy-to-understand manner, facilitating informed decision-making.

## Note- I have added the Power BI HR Analytics Dashboard file(.pbix). Few things to keep in mind for the same:

### Disclaimer:
This Power BI (.pbix) file is not viewable directly on GitHub due to platform limitations. GitHub does not support the interactive rendering of Power BI files. Please follow the steps below to view the content:
